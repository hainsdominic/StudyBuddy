# Study Buddy

A tool for observing your ability to focus while doing a task.

Using OpenCV and Haar Cascades, this tool checks for when you are distracted (when your eyes are not looking at the screen) every second and then saves and plot the resulting data.

You can use this software to check which factors affect your focus such as coffee, music, open-space vs closed-space, etc.
